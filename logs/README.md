# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the application during its execution. The logs help track errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Purpose

- Error tracking and debugging
- Application monitoring

## Log Types

- Error logs: Record exceptions and error conditions

## Usage

The logs are automatically generated by the application's logging system. They follow a standardized format that includes:

- Timestamp
- Log level (ERROR, INFO, WARNING, DEBUG)
- Module/function name
- Detailed message
- Stack trace (for errors)

## Retention

Log files are rotated periodically to prevent excessive disk usage. Old logs are automatically archived or deleted based on the configured retention policy.

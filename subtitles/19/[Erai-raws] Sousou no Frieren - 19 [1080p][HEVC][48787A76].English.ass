Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.30,0:05:11.55,Default,FRIEREN,0000,0000,0000,,A spell that captures a bird.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.35,0:05:17.62,Default,FRIEREN,0000,0000,0000,,It's a folk spell developed by \Na tribe of hunters during an era

Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.99,0:05:34.89,Default,FRIEREN,0000,0000,0000,,It appears it can be used to capture \Nanything that broadly resembles a bird.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.89,0:05:37.03,Default,FRIEREN,0000,0000,0000,,It's a powerful binding spell.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.52,0:05:52.24,Default,FRIEREN,0000,0000,0000,,That spell's range is 50 centimeters.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.30,0:06:10.38,Default,FRIEREN,0000,0000,0000,,So we're one step short \Nof meeting the requirements.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.09,0:07:04.06,Default,KANNE,0000,0000,0000,,But if I infused water with mana, the mana-\Nsensitive Stille would definitely stay away.
